# Pizza Sales Dashboard in Power BI

This Power BI dashboard delivers an in-depth analysis of pizza sales data, designed to uncover key trends and customer preferences that drive business insights. The dashboard includes the following features:

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** The dashboard features essential KPIs such as total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, total orders, and average pizzas per order. These indicators help gauge overall sales performance, customer spending habits, and purchasing behavior, providing a foundation for strategic business decisions.

**Sales Breakdown:** The dashboard includes visualizations on the percentage of sales by pizza category, allowing quick comparisons of popularity among pizza types. Additionally, it provides an analysis of total revenue by pizza size, revealing which sizes contribute most significantly to overall sales.

**Sales Trends:** Daily order trends illustrate sales patterns over time, helping to identify peak days and possible seasonality in customer behavior. Monthly order trends further reveal high-demand months, valuable for understanding peak sales periods and for planning marketing and inventory.

**Top & Bottom Performers:** The dashboard ranks the top and bottom 5 pizzas across three key metricsâ€”revenue, quantity sold, and order count. This ranking allows for quick identification of the most and least profitable, popular, and demanded pizzas.

These insights help determine high-demand days, peak order months, and the best- and worst-performing pizzas, providing actionable data to drive sales strategies, optimize inventory, and improve customer satisfaction.
